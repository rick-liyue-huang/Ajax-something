#### Here provide some ideas I understand and some samples by applying these understandings.

#### I build the environment by MAMP, Charles in mac system, and compile the prog in sublime and webstorm.


#### Firstly, some basic knowledge about here, including PHP, and Ajax. Here we assume that the server database are exist and can be XML and json.

#### Then I [capsulate a tool function](https://github.com/rick-liyue-huang/Ajax-something/tree/master/04.capsulate%20Ajax%20function) to sim the jQuery ajax method, and compare it with the true jQuery ajax method as well.

#### At last, two more contents are introduced, the [Template](https://github.com/rick-liyue-huang/Ajax-something/tree/master/07.ajax%20template) and [Cross-domain](https://github.com/rick-liyue-huang/Ajax-something/tree/master/08.cross%20domain). 

#### Upon thoughts all contain the relative samples.
